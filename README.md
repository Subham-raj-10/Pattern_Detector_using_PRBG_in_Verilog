# 🔍 Pattern Detector with PRBG (Verilog Project)
This project implements a pattern detector that detects the binary sequence `101` from a stream of random bits generated using a **Pseudo Random Bit Generator (PRBG)**. Both modules—PRBG and Detector—are designed in **Verilog HDL** and simulated with a **Verilog testbench**. The design is synthesized and verified on **ZedBoard** using VIO and Vivado.

## 🧠 Project Summary
- Detects the pattern `101` in a serial bitstream.
- Uses a 4-bit PRBG to generate random sequences.
- Synchronous design with `CLK` and `Reset`.
- Simulated with a testbench for loopback verification.

## 📌 Features
- **Random Input Generation** using a two-stage PRBG
- **Pattern Detector** for detecting `101`
- **VIO Integration** for input/output on ZedBoard
- **Synthesis Reports** including **Timing Summary** and **Utilization Metrics**
- **Testbench with Functional Verification**

## ⚙️PRBG Architecture

The Pseudo-Random Bit Generator (PRBG) architecture generates a serial stream of random bits using arithmetic and shift operations. It consists of two parallel blocks, each performing shift, multiply, and add operations on seed values (x₀, y₀). The outputs are registered and compared to produce a random bit zᵢ. This output is fed to a pattern detector that searches for the binary pattern 101.

## ✅ Applications
- 🔐 Cryptography: Random sequence generation for key stream generation.
- 🎰 Testing: Pattern detection in random inputs for hardware verification.
- 🧪 VLSI Labs: Educational tool for FSM and PRBG design.
- 🛰️ Communication Systems: Used in spread-spectrum and secure transmission.

  ## 📌 Notes
- Tested on **Vivado** with **ZedBoard**
- Fully synthesizable and verifiable with on-board VIO
- Can be extended for higher-order PRNG or cryptographic streams
